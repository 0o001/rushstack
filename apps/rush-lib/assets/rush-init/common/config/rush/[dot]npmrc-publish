# This file has the same behavior as common/config/rush/.npmrc -- the only difference is that
# .npmrc-publish is used with "rush publish", because publishing often involves different credentials
# and registries than installation.  See the the .npmrc comments for details.

# It is NOT recommended to store authentication tokens in a text file on a lab machine, because
# other unrelated processes may be able to read the file.  Also, the file may persist indefinitely,
# for example if the machine loses power.  A safer practice is to pass the token via an
# environment variable, which can be referenced from .npmrc using ${} expansion.  For example:
#
#   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}
#
