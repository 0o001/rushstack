      "comment": "Retired the use of the .heft/build-cache folder for persisting build state across the \"heft clean\" or \"--clean\" invocation. Incremental TypeScript compilation is now performed either by running \"heft build\" (without \"--clean\"), or using watch mode, and requires the tsconfig to manually opt in. The feature reduced performance of cold builds and introduced bugs due to stale caches that confused users.",
