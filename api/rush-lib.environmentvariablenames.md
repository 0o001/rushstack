## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  RUSH\_ABSOLUTE\_SYMLINKS | <code>&quot;RUSH_ABSOLUTE_SYMLINKS&quot;</code> | If this variable is set to "true", Rush will create symlinks with absolute paths instead of relative paths. This can be necessary when a repository is moved during a build or if parts of a repository are moved into a sandbox. |
|  RUSH\_PREVIEW\_VERSION | <code>&quot;RUSH_PREVIEW_VERSION&quot;</code> | This variable overrides the version of Rush that will be installed by the version selector. The default value is determined by the "rushVersion" field from rush.json. |
|  RUSH\_TEMP\_FOLDER | <code>&quot;RUSH_TEMP_FOLDER&quot;</code> | This variable overrides the temporary folder used by Rush. The default value is "common/temp" under the repository root. |
|  RUSH\_VARIANT | <code>&quot;RUSH_VARIANT&quot;</code> | This variable selects a specific installation variant for Rush to use when installing and linking package dependencies. For more information, see this article: https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/installation\_variants/ |
