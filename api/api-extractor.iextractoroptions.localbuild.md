# IExtractorOptions.localBuild property

Indicates that API Extractor is running as part of a local build, e.g. on developer's machine. This disables certain validation that would normally be performed for a ship/production build. For example, the \*.api.ts signature file is automatically local in a debug build. 

 The default value is false.

**Signature:**
```javascript
localBuild: boolean
```
