# IExtractorDtsRollupConfig.trimming property

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

If "trimming" is false (the default), then a single \*.d.ts rollup file will be generated in the "publishFolder". If "trimming" is true, then three separate \*.d.ts rollups will be generated in "publishFolderForInternal", "publishFolderForBeta", and "publishFolderForPublic".

**Signature:**
```javascript
trimming: boolean
```

## Remarks

In either case, "mainDtsRollupPath" indicates the relative file path.
