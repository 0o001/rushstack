## Rush.launchRushX() method

This API is used by the `@microsoft/rush` front end to launch the "rushx" command-line. Third-party tools should not use this API. Instead, they should execute the "rushx" binary and start a new NodeJS process.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static launchRushX(launcherVersion: string, isManaged: boolean): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  launcherVersion | <code>string</code> | The version of the <code>@microsoft/rush</code> wrapper used to call invoke the CLI. |
|  isManaged | <code>boolean</code> | True if the tool was invoked from within a project with a rush.json file, otherwise false. We consider a project without a rush.json to be "unmanaged" and we'll print that to the command line when the tool is executed. This is mainly used for debugging purposes. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`void`
