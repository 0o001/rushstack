      "description": "Storybook's conventional approach is for your app project to have direct dependencies\non NPM packages such as `@storybook/react` and `@storybook/addon-essentials`.  These packages have\nheavyweight dependencies such as Babel, Webpack, and the associated loaders and plugins needed to\nbuild the Storybook app (which is bundled completely independently from Heft).  Naively adding these\ndependencies to your app's package.json muddies the waters of two radically different toolchains,\nand is likely to lead to dependency conflicts, for example if Heft installs Webpack 5 but\n`@storybook/react` installs Webpack 4. To solve this problem, `heft-storybook-plugin` introduces the concept of a separate\n\"storykit package\".  All of your Storybook NPM packages are moved to be dependencies of the\nstorykit.  Storybook's browser API unfortunately isn't separated into dedicated NPM packages,\nbut instead is exported by the Node.js toolchain packages such as `@storybook/react`.  For\nan even cleaner separation the storykit package can simply reexport such APIs.",
